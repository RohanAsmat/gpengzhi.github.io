A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of node P is greater than the key of node C. A heap can be classified further as either a "max heap" or a "min heap". In a max heap, the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node. In a min heap, the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node.
