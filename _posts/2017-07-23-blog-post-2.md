I am a Ph.D candidate in Electrical Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Department of Electrical, Computer & Systems Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Meng Wang. I obtained my M.S. at University of Pennsylvania (Penn), and received my B.S. (with honors) in Electronic and Information Engineering from Xidian University. My research interests lie in the intersection of the fields of signal processing, high-dimensional statistics, and machine learning.
