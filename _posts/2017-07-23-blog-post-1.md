Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing a sample of k items from a list S containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number. Typically n is large enough that the list doesn't fit into main memory.

Example: Sample size 1

Suppose we see a sequence of items, one at a time. We want to keep a single item in memory, and we want it to be selected at random from the sequence. If we know the total number of items (n), then the solution is easy: select an index i between 1 and n with equal probability, and keep the i-th element. The problem is that we do not always know n in advance. A possible solution is the following:

Keep the first item in memory.

When the i-th item arrives (for i>1):
* with probability 1/i, keep the new item (discard the old one)
* with probability 1-1/i, keep the old item (ignore the new one)

So:

when there is only one item, it is kept with probability 1;
when there are 2 items, each of them is kept with probability 1/2;
when there are 3 items, the third item is kept with probability 1/3, and each of the previous 2 items are also kept with probability (1/2)(1-1/3) = (1/2)(2/3) = 1/3;
by induction, it is easy to prove that when there are n items, each item is kept with probability 1/n.
